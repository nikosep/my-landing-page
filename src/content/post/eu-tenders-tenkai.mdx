Billions in public procurement go unclaimed every year—not because there’s no demand, but because vendors can’t find relevant tenders in time.

Enter **[Tenkai](https://tenkai.tech)**, your web data agent for turning fragmented EU tender portals into a searchable lead source.

## The Challenge of EU Tender Data

Each EU country runs different portals. Formats vary. Languages differ. Deadlines are inconsistent.

Tenkai solves this by:
- Crawling multiple tender portals (TED, national platforms, regional sites)
- Extracting CPV codes, budgets, locations, and award criteria
- Delivering a unified, filterable dataset

## Unlock Public Sector Opportunities

With Tenkai, you can ask:
> “Show me cybersecurity-related tenders in Germany closing in 10 days.”

Tenkai responds instantly, with structured data ready for integration into your CRM, Slack, or BI dashboard.

Try it now at **[https://tenkai.tech](https://tenkai.tech)** — turn public tenders into private opportunities.

## Beyond Discovery: Chat With Your Data

Using LLM integrations, Tenkai enables you to *chat directly* with your dataset — no coding required.

Just ask questions like:
- “Which contracts mention AI?”
- “What’s the average bid amount for IT tenders in Q2?”
