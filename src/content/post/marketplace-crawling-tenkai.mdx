Product data across marketplaces is a mess—duplicate listings, inconsistent prices, missing reviews, and broken availability info.

**[Tenkai](https://tenkai.tech)** is the fix.

## Structured Data from Any Marketplace

Whether you're pulling from:
- Walmart
- Etsy
- Amazon
- Niche aggregators

Tenkai will crawl, parse, and deliver clean, column-based data.

## No-Code Access to Complex Feeds

With Tenkai’s conversational layer, you can ask:
> “List all smartphones under $300 with 4+ stars sold by verified sellers.”

The agent runs the crawl, extracts the data, and delivers it back—structured and filterable.

## Turn Chaos into Business Advantage

Start with raw HTML. End with insights. That’s the promise of Tenkai.
