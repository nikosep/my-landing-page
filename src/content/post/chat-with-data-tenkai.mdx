Imagine if you could just *ask the internet a question* and get structured, up-to-date answers from real websites. That’s what **[Tenkai](https://tenkai.tech)** enables.

## The Agent Model: Crawl, Clean, Converse

Tenkai isn't just a scraper—it's a **conversational agent** that:
- Crawls websites
- Extracts relevant data
- Lets you ask questions using natural language

No need to write code, parse JSON, or manage proxies.

## Example Use Cases

- “What’s the average rating for plumbers in Amsterdam?”
- “Are there any EU grants related to renewable energy?”
- “Track weekly price changes on SSDs from Walmart.”

Tenkai will crawl, extract, summarize, and present it conversationally.

## Get Started with Chat-Driven Scraping

Skip APIs. Skip manual scripts.

Use **https://tenkai.tech** to focus on your use case, not the backend complexity.
