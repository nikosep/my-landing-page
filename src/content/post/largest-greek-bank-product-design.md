In today's data-driven landscape, organizations, particularly banks, are inundated with vast amounts of valuable data. Unlocking the full potential of this data through effective monetization strategies has become crucial. Going beyond traditional data management, the focus now shifts towards leveraging this data to create innovative commercial products that not only enhance existing services but also generate new revenue streams. This shift towards data monetization represents an essential evolution in business strategy, empowering organizations to capitalize on their data assets and stay ahead in a competitive market.

## The challenge articulated by the Greek banking institution

The bank approached us with a significant dataset derived from card transactions, encompassing a vast majority of Greece's market. Understanding the potential inherent in this wealth of data, their request was clear: to develop a commercial product that leverages these insights to deliver substantial value to merchants. The focus was on crafting a robust B2B offering that utilizes data-driven insights to uncover customer behavioral patterns. Our task was to translate this extensive dataset into actionable insights that empower merchants to make informed decisions, optimize their strategies, and ultimately enhance their business performance in a dynamic market landscape.
