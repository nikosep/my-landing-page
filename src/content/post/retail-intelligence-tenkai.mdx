In today's hyper-competitive eCommerce world, the ability to track product listings, competitor pricing, and customer reviews in real-time is no longer optional — it's essential. 

That’s why more companies are turning to **[Tenkai](https://tenkai.tech)**, a web crawling and scraping agent that transforms unstructured website content into clean, structured datasets.

## Why Retailers Struggle with Data

Retailers need to monitor thousands of SKUs across platforms like Walmart, Amazon, and niche marketplaces. APIs are limited, data is delayed, and product variations constantly change.

Manual scraping is unsustainable, and commercial APIs often fall short.

## Tenkai to the Rescue

**Tenkai** acts as your automated web data agent. It:
- Crawls eCommerce platforms
- Extracts product titles, prices, availability, and ratings
- Returns clean, queryable JSON or CSV output

And best of all — you can even **chat with the data**: “What are the top-rated kitchen blenders on Walmart this week?” and get instant answers.

## Focus on Insights, Not Infrastructure

With **Tenkai**, your team doesn’t need to worry about managing proxies, rotating agents, or parsing inconsistent HTML structures. That’s all handled for you.

Just tell Tenkai what you want to track — and focus on acting on the results.
