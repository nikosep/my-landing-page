In today’s climate of inflation and global uncertainty, grocery stores, supermarkets, and the broader consumer packaged goods (CPG) sector have become highly dynamic industries. Companies are navigating rapidly shifting consumer behaviors, where price sensitivity, discounts, and promotions are more critical than ever in influencing purchasing decisions.

As competition intensifies, brands are focused on strategic pricing and effective discounting to protect and expand their market share. Understanding price elasticity and promotion effectiveness has become essential for CPG companies aiming to stay competitive and meet changing customer needs amidst economic pressures.
